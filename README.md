# MLT-project-
1.First step is data collection
  - I used Kaggle for it - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/human-action-recognition-har-dataset/data
    
2.Load and explore your dataset. 
  - Understand the features and labels.
  - Clean the dataâ€”handle missing values, outliers, and ensure proper formatting.
  - Normalize or standardize features if needed.
  - Split data into training and testing sets.
    
3.Extract relevant features
  - Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA if needed.
  - Select important features that contribute most to classification.
    
4.Choosing & Training a Basic Model 
  - Using deep learning (CNN based approach) for this project.
    
5.Evaluate Model's accuracy 
  - Using confusion matrix.
    
6.Final Testing and presentation 
  - Shown 10 images with there predicted and actual labels.
